This was just me practicing how to submit something with JS

link to see how it turned out -> https://devjakov.github.io/book-list-JS/

I learned how to edit a list and manipulate the DOM
I learned basic local storage and how to load info with DOMContentLoaded
I learned how to make my custom alert and error messages

I utilized all of this in a more expanded and clearer way with my 'track-calories-JS' project 
https://devjakov.github.io/track-calorie-JS-project/

This one though was just practice :D

Cheers, Jakov
